**Recommendations** 

The main challenges faced by this business are overreliance on a few key customers and issues with customer retention. To address these challenges, the company can implement the following strategies:

1. Utilize RFN analysis to identify six distinct customer segments: best, occasional big spenders, regulars, potential regulars, almost lost, and lost low spenders. Tailor marketing efforts and resources to target each segment effectively, enhancing their buying experiences.
2. Gather additional information, such as customer reviews/ratings post-purchase and data on the devices they use to browse and complete online transactions. This data is crucial for identifying and addressing customer pain points, particularly for the almost lost, regular, and potential regular customer segments.
3. Leverage the detailed insights provided by the Drillthrough1 page, which offers comprehensive information on product preferences, order quantities, and ordering periods (months) for each customer. Utilize this data for targeted promotional campaigns aimed at boosting sales and customer engagement.
